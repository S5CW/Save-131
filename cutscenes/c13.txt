Prof. Lye:Who's ready to get midterms back, mythologists?
{2}:I hope the midterm went alright.
{2}:Anyone else getting deja-vu?
Midterm: 100% - A                     
{2}:No way, this is awesome.
Prof. Lye:{2}, well done! It's almost like you wrote the myths yourself!
{2}: ...
Prof. Lye:I thought you'd be happier ... anyway really great work!
{2}:*I can't believe it worked!*
{2}:*My trusty time machine worked after all.*
{2}:Mythology is saved; my grade is saved ...
{2}:I might even pass 131 now!
{2}:Thanks Professor Lye! You're the best!

Apollo:The Muses will forever sing the epic of History-Saving {2}.
